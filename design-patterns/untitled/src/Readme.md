## Strategy Design pattern 

# In the inheritence lets assume we have a vehicle base class 
# it has one drive method  
   Now the child classes has different implementation for drive method 
   and the if some child classes has the same implementation then it is 
   a code redundency issue we can solve this issue using the 
   strategy design pattern we can create one base interface 
   we can create the multiple concrete classes
